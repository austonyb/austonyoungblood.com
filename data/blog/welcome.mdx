### My name is Auston Youngblood. 

Iâ€™m a creator, tinkerer, mobile developer, husband, soon-to-be dad, and a big time nerd! 

This blog is a landing zone for all of the updates, guides, and other things relating to my projects and hobbies.

You can expect interesting projects, dive-ins to iOS and SwiftUI, drones, filmmaking, and much, much more!

Enjoy reading!


_Cheers,_

Auston
