# bigTimeNerd.dev

Before I created this site, I had another plan in mind, bigTimeNerd. 

My first big project at DevMountain was all about this site. I don't have the site up anymore (unfortunate casualty of Heroku's pricing changes...).

The focus went from the site to a podcast instead. It was orginally a weekly podcast, but now has become an off and on type of project. I cover topics ranging from generative AI, getting into the job market, and pop culture. 

Check out some of my episodes below:
